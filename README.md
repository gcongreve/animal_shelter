# animal_shelter
The "It's Not Their Fault Animal Shelter" is my week 4/5 Project at CodeClan, Edinburgh. The database is called animal_shelter.

It requires:
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem 

(create database from terminal:  createdb animal_shelter / psql -d animal_shelter -f animal_shelter.sql )

The Brief:

The Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

A list of all their animals and their admission date
Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
Assign an animal to a new owner
List all the owners and their adopted animals
CRUD actions for animals/owners
Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
Search for animals by breed/type

Rules

The project must be built using only:

HTML / CSS
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
